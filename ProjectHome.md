The intent of this project is to create a web-based sports league management and administration suite. Of the options I've explored Ruby on Rails seem to be particularly well suited for the task at hand.

The suite should be (at least) be able to:

**Have a roles-based access** Support different seasons
**store all matches and report** on-line roster entry
**game report generation (PDF, or other format)**
